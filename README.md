# Sovereignty Analysis

This project analyzes user sovereignty across different layers of decentralized applications (DApps), including frameworks for evaluating storage and blockchain trilemmas.

## Decentralized Access

This project is published on IPFS and accessible through decentralized naming:

- **IPNS**: Published on a self-hosted IPFS node
  - IPNS Key: `k51qzi5uqu5dlvfgpl2lty2qjrhly2qzoxwb5pqjtmcc9xljvt84ykaoe3a9jt`
  - Project Name: `Sovereignty_analysis`

- **ENS**: Linked via Ethereum Name Service
  - Domain: `sovereigntyanalysis.eth`
  - Access: https://sovereigntyanalysis.eth.limo/

The IPNS record points to the latest version of the project on IPFS, and the ENS domain resolves to this IPNS record, providing a human-readable decentralized address for the project.
